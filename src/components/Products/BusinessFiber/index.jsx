          What Is Fiber-Optic Internet?
        </h1>

          text={
            "Fiber-optic internet is a broadband connection that transmits data at hundreds of Megabits per second (Mbps). Instead of transmitting data wirelessly or as electricity, fiber internet uses small fiber cables to transmit data as pulses of light, with less electromagnetic interference. Less interference means faster speeds."
