              Most companies & small businesses who deal directly with carriers
              end up paying too much for services that are over-subscribed and
              not forward looking. With our significant industry experience, we
              eliminate the confusion of self-serving sales pitches, too many
              choices, and biased information to quickly zero in on the best
              combination of services and products for your business. We then
              negotiate with the carriers on your behalf for the guaranteed
              lowest available market prices on local service, long distance and
              internet connectivity.

              Save 20% to 60% on voice & data services. Nearly 80% of new
              businesses are over-sold services by the major telecommunications
              carriers. Even when existing businesses attempt to improve their
              services by changing their carrier they often end up paying more
              for fewer services. As your advocate, TelcoSolutions will search
              for ways you can cut your costs and seek solutions that SAVE you
              money not cost you money.
