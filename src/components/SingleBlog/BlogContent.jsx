            In today’s digital age, most businesses rely on the Internet for
            just about everything, from video conferencing and point-of-sale
            transactions to cloud computing. Unfortunately, internet service
            interruptions do happen.

            There’s hardly a good time for an internet outage, but it always
            seems to happen at the worst possible time. Even the best internet
            connections drop from time to time, and it helps to understand what
            causes internet outages and how it affects your business.

            Your internet equipment, including your modem and router, bring in
            the signal and distribute it to your devices. Should any of these
            gadgets fail or malfunction, it can cause an internet outage.{" "}

            Sometimes, vandals, construction workers, or landscapers may
            intentionally or accidentally damage internet infrastructure and
            cause an outage. Similarly, accidental mismanagement or poor network
            configuration may lead to network downtime.

            Even a minor storm could damage infrastructure that brings internet
